# Cybersecurity Threat Monitoring Dashboard

This is a Streamlit application designed to monitor and visualize cybersecurity threats. It provides insights into various threat types, their severity, and historical data on incidents. The application is built using Python and several key libraries such as Streamlit, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Altair.

## Requirements

To run this application, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version
```

The application requires the following Python packages:

- `pandas`
- `streamlit`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `altair`
- `streamlit-card`

You can install these dependencies using `pip`.

## Installation

### Key Steps:

1. **Clone the repo or download project files.**

   First, clone the repository or download the project files. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-name
   cd your-project-directory
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended).**

   It's recommended to create a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects. To create the virtual environment, run the following command:

   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```

   This will create a folder named `.venv` in your project directory.

   To activate the virtual environment, use the following command:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     .venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **Mac/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source .venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install the required dependencies.**

   After activating the virtual environment, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, you can manually install the required libraries using the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas streamlit seaborn matplotlib altair streamlit-card
   ```

4. **Verify the installation.**

   After installation, you can verify the packages installed in your virtual environment by running:

   ```bash
   pip freeze
   ```

   This should show the list of packages that are installed, including all the dependencies for the project.

## Running the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application using the following command:

```bash
streamlit run index.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and open the application in your default web browser.

If the browser doesn't open automatically, you can visit the following URL manually:

```
http://localhost:8501
```

The application will display various cybersecurity threat metrics and visualizations.

## Features

- **Threat Severity Distribution**: A semi-pie chart displaying the distribution of normal vs. abnormal threats.
- **Anomalies by Type**: A pie chart showing the distribution of different types of threats.
- **Threat Count by Type**: A bar chart showing the number of anomalies detected for each threat type.
- **Historical Incident Data**: A line chart visualizing the number of incidents over time.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: The sidebar displays alerts with details and provides action buttons to resolve or ignore critical threats.

## Customization

You can modify the data in the script (`index.py`) to reflect different threat types, severity levels, and historical data as per your requirements.

## Troubleshooting

- **Streamlit not installed**: If Streamlit is not installed, you can install it using:

  ```bash
  pip install streamlit
  ```

- **Missing dependencies**: If you encounter missing dependencies, you can install them individually using `pip` or by running:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- **Virtual environment issues**: If you have trouble activating the virtual environment, make sure that you've correctly followed the setup steps for your operating system.

### Key Steps Recap:

1. **Clone the repo or download project files.**
2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - **Windows**: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
   - **Mac/Linux**: `source .venv/bin/activate`
4. **Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:**
   ```bash
